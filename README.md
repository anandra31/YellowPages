Hello readers, i am Emyr, a current student at purwadhika, taking the data science & machine learning course.
This file is a mandatory project for the completion of module 1, which focuses on the basics of coding (python).

This yellow pages application is a phone book application. This application has the ability to view, add, modify, and delete data

feel free to take a look / give any suggestions on how i can improve my coding further.

Thank you!
